            ' sssss dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. eeeee ',
            ' sssss dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. these two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. in dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other. eeeee ',
            ' sssss although the above broad definition covers all forms of the art, philosophers and critics throughout history have suggested different definitions of dance that have amounted to little more than descriptions of the kind of dance with which each writer was most familiar. thus, aristotle’s statement in the poetics that dance is rhythmic movement whose purpose is “to represent men’s characters as well as what they do and suffer” refers to the central role that dance played in classical greek theatre, where the chorus through its movements reenacted the themes of the drama during lyric interludes. eeeee ',
            ' sssss the english ballet master john weaver, writing in 1721, argued on the other hand that “dancing is an elegant, and regular movement, harmoniously composed of beautiful attitudes, and contrasted graceful posture of the body, and parts thereof.” weaver’s description reflects very clearly the kind of dignified and courtly movement that characterized the ballet of his time, with its highly formalized aesthetics and lack of forceful emotion. the 19th-century french dance historian gaston vuillier also emphasized the qualities of grace, harmony, and beauty, distinguishing “true” dance from the supposedly crude and spontaneous movements of early man: eeeee ',
            ' sssss the choreographic art . . . was probably unknown to the earlier ages of humanity. savage man, wandering in forests, devouring the quivering flesh of his spoils, can have known nothing of those rhythmic postures which reflect sweet and caressing sensations entirely alien to his moods. the nearest approach to such must have been the leaps and bounds, the incoherent gestures, by which he expressed the joys and furies of his brutal life. eeeee ',
            ' sssss john martin, the 20th-century dance critic, almost ignored the formal aspect of dance in emphasizing its role as a physical expression of inner emotion. in doing so, he betrayed his own sympathy toward the expressionist school of modern american dance: “at the root of all these varied manifestations of dancing . . . lies the common impulse to resort to movement to externalise states which we cannot externalise by rational means. this is basic dance.” eeeee ',
            ' sssss a truly universal definition of dance must, therefore, return to the fundamental principle that dance is an art form or activity that utilizes the body and the range of movement of which the body is capable. unlike the movements performed in everyday living, dance movements are not directly related to work, travel, or survival. dance may, of course, be made up of movements associated with these activities, as in the work dances common to many cultures, and it may even accompany such activities. but even in the most practical dances, movements that make up the dance are not reducible to those of straightforward labour; rather, they involve some extra qualities such as self-expression, aesthetic pleasure, and entertainment. eeeee ',
            ' sssss this article discusses the techniques and components of dance as well as the aesthetic principles behind its appreciation as an art. various types of dance are discussed with emphasis on their style and choreography. the history of dance in various regions is treated in a number of articles; see dance, african; music and dance, oceanic; dance, western; arts, central asian; arts, east asian; arts, islamic; dance, native american; arts, south asian; and arts, southeast asian. the interaction between dance and other art forms is discussed in folk dance. eeeee ',
            ' sssss one of the most basic motives of dance is the expression and communication of emotion. people—and even certain animals—often dance as a way of releasing powerful feelings, such as sudden accesses of high spirits, joy, impatience, or anger. these motive forces can be seen not only in the spontaneous skipping, stamping, and jumping movements often performed in moments of intense emotion, but also in the more formalized movements of “set” dances, such as tribal war dances or festive folk dances. here the dance helps to generate emotions as well as release them. eeeee ',
            ' sssss people also dance for the pleasure of experiencing the body and the surrounding environment in new and special ways. dance often involves movement being taken to an extreme, with, for example, the arms being flung or stretched out, the head lifted back, and the body arched or twisted. also, it often involves a special effort or stylization, such as high kicks, leaps, or measured walks. dance movements tend to be organized into a spatial or rhythmic pattern, tracing lines or circles on the ground, following a certain order of steps, or conforming to a pattern of regular accents or stresses. eeeee ',
            ' sssss all of these characteristics may produce a state of mind and body that is very different from that of everyday experience. the dance requires unaccustomed patterns of muscular exertion and relaxation as well as an unusually intense or sustained expenditure of energy. the dancer may become intensely aware of the force of gravity and of a state of equilibrium or disequilibrium that normal activities do not generate. at the same time, the dance creates a very different perception of time and space for the dancer: time is marked by the rhythmic ordering of movement and by the duration of the dance, and space is organized around the paths along which the dancer travels or around the shapes made by the body. eeeee ',
            ' sssss dance can, in fact, create a completely self-contained world for dancers, in which they are capable of physical effort, prowess, and endurance far beyond their normal powers. sufi dervishes, as an extreme example, can whirl ecstatically for long stretches of time without appearing tired or giddy, and certain indonesian dancers can strike daggers against their naked chests without causing apparent pain or injury. eeeee ',
            ' sssss this transcendence of the everyday may also be experienced by the spectators. drawn into the rhythms and patterns created by the dancer’s movements, they may begin to share in the emotions being expressed through them. they may also experience kinesthetically something similar to the physical sensations of the dancer. kinesthesia, or the awareness of the body through sensations in the joints, muscles, and tendons, rather than through visual perception, not only defines the dancer’s experience of his or her own body in movement but also the way in which dance exerts its power over the spectators, who not only see it but also feel an echo of the dancer’s movements and rhythms in their own nerve endings. eeeee ',

              ' sssss the white stripes, american rock duo from detroit, known for combining punk, folk, country, and mississippi delta blues. original band members were guitarist-vocalist jack white (original name john anthony gillis; b. july 9, 1975, detroit, michigan, u.s.) and drummer meg white (original name megan martha white; b. december 10, 1974, grosse pointe farms, michigan). eeeee ',
              ' sssss during the 1990s meg held a variety of service jobs, and jack worked as a furniture upholsterer. exposed to a wide range of music by his employer, brian muldoon, jack became interested in the sound of detroit punk pioneers iggy and the stooges and the mc5. jack (on guitar) and muldoon recorded a blues-infused single under the name the upholsterers. trading one set of influences for another, in 1993 jack signed on as drummer for the established “cow-punk” band goober and the peas. jack gained experience onstage and in the recording studio, and the group’s sound (a fusion of punk and rockabilly) and its stage persona (featuring cowboy hats and embroidered western suits) would reappear in his later work. in 1996 goober and the peas broke up, and jack and meg were married. (although jack and meg claimed to be brother and sister, the media eventually discovered a marriage license [1996] and a divorce certificate [2000].) that year the couple moved into jack’s childhood home, and they began to craft the sound of the white stripes. the duo played at venues around detroit, frequently appearing with two-star tabernacle, a country-rock outfit that featured jack and former goober and the peas front man dan miller. the white stripes signed a contract with the independent sympathy for the record industry label, and the duo’s self-titled debut album was released in 1999. it was followed the next year by de stijl. eeeee ',
              ' sssss in 2001 the white stripes released their breakthrough album, white blood cells. michel gondry’s eye-catching video for the single “fell in love with a girl” received regular airplay on mtv, and the group became media darlings. the duo followed with elephant (2003), a percussion-driven collection of songs that featured meg’s debut as a vocalist. elephant earned a grammy award for best alternative music album, and it sold over a million copies on the strength of singles such as “seven nation army” and “the hardest button to button.” jack appeared in the film cold mountain (2003), and he contributed five songs to its grammy-nominated soundtrack. he also produced country legend loretta lynn’s van lear rose (2004), a collection of honky-tonk anthems that earned a pair of grammy awards and introduced lynn to a new generation of fans. the white stripes earned another grammy for their album get behind me satan (2005), and the song “icky thump,” from their album of the same name (2007), became the band’s first top 40 hit on the billboard singles chart. in addition, icky thump was the white stripes’ third recording to earn the grammy for best alternative music album, and the title song was also awarded a grammy. eeeee ',
              ' sssss the white stripes went on hiatus in 2007 after meg was afflicted with performance-related anxiety. they returned to the stage for a single performance in february 2009 for the final episode of late night with conan o’brien. continuing to expand his body of work, jack experimented with straightforward power pop as a member of the raconteurs. the quartet produced a pair of well-received albums (2006 and 2008) and quickly became a fixture on the summer concert circuit. meg married guitarist jackson smith (son of rock legend patti smith) in may 2009, and jack undertook yet another side project. enlisting members of the kills and queens of the stone age, jack formed the dead weather, a bluesy psychedelic rock combo whose debut album, horehound, was released in july 2009. eeeee ',
              ' sssss in march 2009 jack founded third man records, a nashville record store, performance space, and label. as the rest of the music industry was trying to adjust its business model to accommodate digital downloads, white’s label embraced the physical artifacts of the album era: the turntable, the gatefold cover, and, above all, high-quality vinyl releases. as jack spent more time on third man and other projects—he produced the party ain’t over, the 2011 comeback album from rockabilly legend wanda jackson—white stripes fans began to suspect that the band’s hiatus might be permanent. this was confirmed when in february 2011 meg and jack announced that they would no longer record or appear as the white stripes. the following year jack embarked on a solo career with the stylistically expansive blunderbuss. eeeee ']},

                        'sssss during the 1990s meg held a variety of service jobs, and jack worked as a furniture upholsterer. exposed to a wide range of music by his employer, brian muldoon, jack became interested in the sound of detroit punk pioneers iggy and the stooges and the mc5. jack (on guitar) and muldoon recorded a blues-infused single under the name the upholsterers. trading one set of influences <em>for</em> another, in 1993 jack signed on as drummer <em>for</em> the established “cow-punk” band goober and the peas. jack gained experience onstage and in the recording studio, and the group’s sound (a fusion of punk and rockabilly) and its stage persona (featuring cowboy hats and embroidered western suits) would reappear in his later work. in 1996 goober and the peas broke up, and jack and meg were married. (although jack and meg claimed to be brother and sister, the media eventually discovered a marriage license [1996] and a divorce certificate [2000].) that year the couple moved into jack’s childhood home, and they began to craft the sound of the white stripes. the duo played at venues around detroit, frequently appearing with two-star tabernacle, a country-rock outfit that featured jack and former goober and the peas front man dan miller. the white stripes signed a contract with the independent sympathy <em>for</em> the record industry label, and the duo’s self-titled debut album was released in 1999. it was followed the next year by de stijl. eeeee',
                        'sssss in 2001 the white stripes released their breakthrough album, white blood cells. michel gondry’s eye-catching video <em>for</em> the single “fell in love with a girl” received regular airplay on mtv, and the group became media darlings. the duo followed with elephant (2003), a percussion-driven collection of songs that featured meg’s debut as a vocalist. elephant earned a grammy award <em>for</em> best alternative music album, and it sold over a million copies on the strength of singles such as “seven nation army” and “the hardest button to button.” jack appeared in the film cold mountain (2003), and he contributed five songs to its grammy-nominated soundtrack. he also produced country legend loretta lynn’s van lear rose (2004), a collection of honky-tonk anthems that earned a pair of grammy awards and introduced lynn to a new generation of fans. the white stripes earned another grammy <em>for</em> their album get behind me satan (2005), and the song “icky thump,” from their album of the same name (2007), became the band’s first top 40 hit on the billboard singles chart. in addition, icky thump was the white stripes’ third recording to earn the grammy <em>for</em> best alternative music album, and the title song was also awarded a grammy. eeeee',
                        'sssss the white stripes went on hiatus in 2007 after meg was afflicted with performance-related anxiety. they returned to the stage <em>for</em> a single performance in february 2009 <em>for</em> the final episode of late night with conan o’brien. continuing to expand his body of work, jack experimented with straightforward power pop as a member of the raconteurs. the quartet produced a pair of well-received albums (2006 and 2008) and quickly became a fixture on the summer concert circuit. meg married guitarist jackson smith (son of rock legend patti smith) in may 2009, and jack undertook yet another side project. enlisting members of the kills and queens of the stone age, jack formed the dead weather, a bluesy psychedelic rock combo whose debut album, horehound, was released in july 2009. eeeee']}},

              ' sssss golden globe award, any of the awards presented annually by the hollywood foreign press association (hfpa) in recognition of outstanding achievement in motion pictures and television during the previous year. within the entertainment industry, the golden globes are considered second in importance both to the academy awards (for film) and to the emmy awards (for television), and the televised awards ceremony is a comparably lavish affair. eeeee ',
              ' sssss for each medium, golden globes are given in several categories. the film awards include those for best motion picture, best actor, and best actress, each separated into “drama” and “comedy or musical” divisions. supporting acting performances, direction, screenwriting, music, animated films, and foreign-language films are also honoured. the television awards include those for drama series, comedy or musical series, miniseries or movies, as well as for acting performances in each genre or format. for all competitive awards, members of the hfpa cast ballots to determine a slate of nominees and then usually a single winner in each category. in most years, the cecil b. demille award, a prize for lifetime achievement, is also bestowed. golden globe winners receive a statuette consisting of a globe encircled by a strip of film. eeeee ',
              ' sssss the presentation of the awards originated in 1944 as an endeavour of the newly formed hollywood foreign correspondents association, a consortium of entertainment journalists based in los angeles but working for publications outside the united states. in 1955, upon the reincorporation of a short-lived splinter group, it was renamed the hfpa. the following year the golden globe awards, which initially honoured only motion pictures, featured its first prizes for television. the awards gala began to be televised nationally in the mid-1960s. eeeee ',
              ' sssss questions of credibility have dogged the golden globe awards for much of their history, in part because of accusations of impropriety that the hfpa has occasionally suffered. in 1968, for instance, the federal communications commission, investigating nbc’s broadcast of the golden globes, contended that the hfpa had “substantially misled the public” regarding its procedures for selecting winners; one particular allegation was that the organization had negotiated to extend awards to some performers in exchange for their attendance at the ceremony. in 1982 it was revealed that the husband of actress pia zadora, the winner of an award that was widely considered to be undeserved, had furnished voters with various favours. both incidents resulted in the disappearance of the ceremony from network television for several years. eeeee ',
              ' sssss by the 21st century, however, the increasing importance placed by the entertainment industry on awards of all kinds had conferred an air of prestige on the long-running golden globes. the golden globes for film were observed closely as precursors to the oscars, and the ceremony was frequently among television’s most-watched events. however, the future of the golden globes came into doubt in 2021. following continued allegations of ethics violations and criticism about the hfpa’s lack of diversity, nbc announced that it would not televise the ceremony, beginning in 2022. that year the awards were announced on social media. eeeee ',
